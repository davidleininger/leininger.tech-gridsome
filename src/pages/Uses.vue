      <h1 class="text-black dark:text-white text-5xl font-mono mb-2">Uses</h1>
      <p>Just like everyone else, this was inspired by <a href="https://wesbos.com/uses">Wes Bos</a>. These are things I use on a daily basis that make my life better, easier, or opinionated. You probably don’t really care, but I bet I’ve got a trick or two you don’t know about...</p>
      <h2>Dev Stuff</h2>
      <h3>VS Code</h3>
      <p>VS Code is the editor where I sling code. I’ve been a pretty big from since... a while now. I liked VS Code before, but I like it so much more after going through Caleb Porzio’s Make VS Code Awesome course.</p>
      <h3>Hyper</h3>
      <p>Hyper is my go to terminal when I’m not inside of VS Code. Usually, I just use hyper to start up new projects and then pop into VS Code.</p>
      <h3>Cobalt Next</h3>
      <p>I built for prertty much everything: VS Code, Hyper, Alfred, Insomnia, and this site.</p>
      <h3>Operator Mono</h3>
      <p>Yes, I spent $200 on a font for coding. I stare at it every day, and as a designer and type nerd I can honestly say it’s been more than worth it.</p>
      <h3>Dotfiles</h3>
      <p>Files with dots in front that tell my computer what to do and look like. I stole fair and square from a bunch of different people to make these what I wanted. It’s not perfect, but it works for me.</p>

      <h2>Appy Things</h2>
      <h3>Figma</h3>
      <p>Figma is my go to tool for UI design. I can’t imagine another tool hitting the marks that this one does. For color work it’s a wonderful tool, but if you’re on a design team, it’s a must have. </p>

      <h3>Illustrator (Adobe) </h3>
      <p>Long live Adobe... Still the best tool for branding design. Period.</p>

      <h3>Alfred</h3>
      <p>Probably one of the first things I do when I get a new machine is install Alfred. I know that Spotlight isgood, but it’s not good enough. Plus... workflows. </p>

      <h3>Things </h3>
      <p>Getting Things Done - Mostly. I use so many differnt ways of tracking work between family, work, and myself.Things is where I keep my things, but there are a lot of other places where todo items live. </p>

      <h3>aText</h3>
      <p>TextExpander was too expensive. This is basically the same thing. All my dev snippets regarless of editor (even codepen).</p>

      <h3>Contrast </h3>
      <p>Checking color contrast ratios from the menubar. Easy peasy.</p>

      <h3>Frank DeLoupe </h3>
      <p>Use a shortcut, get a color picker for anywhere on your monitor. Simple tool that I use everyday.</p>

      <h3>Bartender</h3>
      <p>Too many menubar apps, so little time. It’s like a Tardis for your menubar. If you understand that, we can be friends. If not, there’s still a chance we can be friends, but you’ve already got one strike.</p>

      <h3>Umbra </h3>
      <p>Switching system color modes with keyboard shortcut. It’s like a dang superpower.</p>

      <h3>Magnet </h3>
      <p>The window snapping that Mac wishes it shipped with. If I didn’t pay for it, I’d use Rectangle.</p>

      <h3>Kap</h3>
      <p>Quickly grab screen captures and export to .gif or .mp4.</p>

      <h3>Notion </h3>
      <p>All my notes and writing is done here first. It’s just the way it goes right now.</p>

      <h3>1Password </h3>
      <p>Swapped from LastPass because their UI was bad. Everyone needs a password manager.</p>

      <h3>Hey </h3>
      <p>My current life goal is to completely get off of Google. Hey, while not perfect, is a good first step.</p>

      <h3>Insomnia </h3>
      <p>REST Client for testing API calls.</p>
