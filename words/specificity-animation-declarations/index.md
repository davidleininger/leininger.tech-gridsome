Specificity can be super confusing, and just when I think I have it really nailed down I learn something new. I'm not sure that I'm going to use this very often, but I didn't know that you can override style declarations with animation declarations. For example:

```css
/* Animation declarations take precedence over normal declarations */
body {
  animation: bg 0s forwards;
}
@keyframes bg {
  to {
    background: yellow;
  }
}

/* This is overridden by the animation declaration above */
body {
  background: crimson;
}
```

In this example the background would be `yellow` because body has the animation declaration on it that overrides the `crimson` lower in the file eventough they have the same level of specificity.
