I have been angry at Figma for a while not for not allowing me to scale type and the bouding box at the same time. This is one of those moments where I was angry thinking they didn't have a solution instead of looking. One quick google on the google machine later, and `k` is my new best friend.

`k` allows you to scale the selected items including fonts. This for me is nice because I can scale to a point that I think works, and then adjust it to my type scape. Figma, thank you for being awesome.

_Note: don't forget to turn off scale by pressing `v`, otherwise you'll scale things you don't mean to. The cursor isn't too obviously different._
