The search inside of the `Elements` tab in the inspector isn't very helpful if you're trying to find specific tags. There is a really simple solution for this, use `* tag`.

For example, if you're searching for an `h2`, use the search term `* h2`. This will pull find all of the elements instead of finding random `h2` text in styles or svgs.
