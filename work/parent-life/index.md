Parent Life launched in April of 2017 as a way for Life Teen to reach parents who have teens in the program. There is general content on the site that anyone can access. When a parish subscribes to Life Teen, they get assigned a parish access code. Parents will then have access to premium content that will help them connect to what their teenagers experience in a Life Teen program. If a parish unsubscribes, the users lose access to the subscribed section of the site.

I used flexbox and css columns to give older posts the ability to be featured again at the top of the site from time to time.
