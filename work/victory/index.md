[The Victory App](http://thevictoryapp.com) was created to help people find freedom from addiction to pornography. Version 1 helped a lot of people, but the app as a whole felt clunky and outdated. Version 2 was completely reimagined from the ground up. It has a much cleaner and more user friendly UI, with many new features and customizations. It is available for download in both the [Apple App Store](http://ltgo.co/victoryios) and the [Google Play Store](http://bit.ly/victoryandroid).

### My Contributions:

The development of this app was primarily outsourced, because of time contraints. I spearheaded the rest of the app, from concept to wireframing to design and prototyping using Adobe XD and Photoshop. I helped with the branding this second version of the app and design language.
