[The Victory App](http://thevictoryapp.com) was created to help people find freedom from addiction to pornography. Version 1 of the app is currently live, and in both the [Apple App Store](http://ltgo.co/victoryios) and the [Google Play Store](http://bit.ly/victoryandroid). Over the past year, I've been working hard on version 2, which will release early 2018.

Version 2 has been completely reimagined from the ground up. It has a much cleaner and more user friendly UI, with many new features and customizations.

### My Contributions:

The development of this app was outsourced, because of time contraints. I spearheaded the rest of the app, from concept to wireframing to design and prototyping using Adobe XD and Photoshop.
