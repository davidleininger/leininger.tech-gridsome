Catholic.af was a pet project between me and [Mike McBride](https://mikemcbride.dev), but sadly, it's dead now. It all started because we found `.af` domain names, and then the fun began. The goal was to create a space for Catholic creators to have a space to show off their work and contribute to Catholic charities. Essentially, we sell the good, recoup the cost, pay the designer, and donate the rest.

Catholic.af was a design and development playground and an experiment in Catholic culture. The first was a blast, but the second turned out basically as expected â€“ hence why it isn't around anymore.

Both Mike and I are developers and we're always looking for a place to play around, make something cool, and have a little fun while we're at it. One of my favorite parts of the site was the hover effect on the main landing page:

<iframe height="500" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Hover Effect: Pop and Background Animate" src="https://codepen.io/davidleininger/embed/mKrroW?default-tab=result&theme-id=dark" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
  See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/davidleininger/pen/mKrroW">
  Hover Effect: Pop and Background Animate</a> by David Leininger (<a href="https://codepen.io/davidleininger">@davidleininger</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

In the end, it was a lot of fun, and I'm glad we did it. I wish people would be a little more open to taking a joke, but there's nothing I can do about that - maybe it's my fault for tiptoeing up to the line... You can take a look at a [partial working version of the app](https://caf.leininger.tech), and we've still got a few shirts and some stickers left, [hit me up](/contact) if you want one.
