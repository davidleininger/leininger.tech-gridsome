The Life Teen Store launched in January 2017 on Shopify. Starting with a pre-built template, and I customized it to fit our unique needs and be cohesive with our main site design. I created a tabbed/accordian solution using meta-data to display content for a better user experience while browsing products.

While building the store, I worked with our in-house photographer so that the products would have a uniform look for a clean store design.

### My Contributions:

Art direction and project management. Built custom sale / bulk pricing engine in Ruby. Integrated custom meta-data into the design.
