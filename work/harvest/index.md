To be completely honest, I started the Harvest Speed & Strength logo as a favor to my brother. I didn't have a lot of expectations for how the logo would be used. At the time, Harvest Speed and Strength was an in-home gym, and there was just a flag on the way.

A few years later, and I'm blown away by how everything came together. The picture above is from [their new gym in San Antonio, TX](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3-jSxCBAoL/), and I love seeing how they are using the brand. I'm just grateful to help make a difference for this gym, while it's making a difference for others.
