[Catholic.af](http://catholic.af) was rebuilt in April of 2015 for Life Teen's 30th anniversary. The website gets an average of 30,000 hits a day. Our CEO wanted to make sure that our site was constantly changing, so I came up with ad blocks on the homepage to trade out content on a regular basis, while featuring our events, resources, and products.

One of the biggest challenges with this site was the navigation. With so many different types of users, I created a mega menu that would allow the user quick access to whatever they might be looking for.

### My Contributions:

Logo Design. Designed in Sktech. Prototyped with Invision. Built with Wordpress, ACF, Foundation, and Sass.
