The [LT goBooks App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lt-gobooks/id965257982) is an iOS app that houses a libray of Life Teen's "Pocket Guides", seasonal companions, and small books. This gives our users the ability to carry a selection of Life Teen books with them wherever they go.

Using the WordPress API, Life Teen can create new books that automatically get submitted to the goBooks store without submitting a new build to the App Store.
