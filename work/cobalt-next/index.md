I believe that my code editor, terminal, and a slew of other mac applications can help increase my productivity and enjoyment in doing what I do. I've spent a lot of time – probably more than I actually want to think about – making and maintaining Cobalt next.

To me, it's time well spent. One of the reasons that I love apple – and have for a long time – is that everything on a mac or iPhone looks like it belongs. Consistency is key, and I wanted to make sure I set up that same level of consistency for me. Making my tools work for me helps me to use them better.

I've got [Cobalt Next](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dline.CobaltNext) for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dline.CobaltNext), [Hyper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyper-cobalt-next) ([dark version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyper-cobalt-next-dark)), Alfred, [Insomnia](https://github.com/mikemcbride/insomnia-plugin-extra-themes), and others I've forgotten since I'm so used to it now.

So much time and so much JSON.
